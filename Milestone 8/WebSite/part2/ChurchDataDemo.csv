1,"Abercrombie, Bethany AFLC (Richland Co.)","(From the Abercrombie, Bethany history: “We do not know the exact date when the church was used for services. According to the minutes of November 15, 1885, the church had neither pews nor pulpit, but they decided to buy chairs until they could afford to buy pews. The pulpit was constructed by O.C. Dahl in 1886. The altar was built by Peter Gylland who was an excellent cabinet maker from Norway. Peder Gylland stayed with Erick and Karen Hendrickson when assembling the altar which was hauled to the church on a hayrack. A dedication service for the church was held during circuit meetings in November 1886.” The altar and pulpit mentioned may not be the present pieces within the church. On 9-6-2000 I documented the altar painting of the “Ascension” with the eleven figures which was completed by Andreas Pedersen in 1898. This was done for my own files as the congregation was AFLC not ELCA. (See Portland, Aurdal.)

3,"Alamo, Zion (Williams Co.)","(For a brief time, the 1914 Alamo, Zion building stood out in the country outside of Alamo until it was moved to the town in 1916. Alamo, Zion was part of a large 1964 merger which formed Alamo, Calvary. This merger included: Alamo, Opdahl-Alamo, Synod -Alamo, Zion-Appam, Bethany and Wildrose, Skabo. Corinth, Corinth joined in 1970 and some members of Zahl, Rudser joined in 1981-1982. From the “Wonder of Williams”, v. 2, p. 1547: Alamo, Zion's “Chancel furniture was secured in 1925”.) (CL)",
4,"Alsen, Zion (Cavalier Co.)","(The church was built in 1913 (Norlie p. 109) and it closed in 1979 (Munich Area History Committee (N.D.). United by Rail: Munich and Surrounding Area. Munich, N.D.: Munich Area History Committee, 2003. p. 321). There is a museum in Alsen, named the Alsen Museum. Contact Roland Spenst at 701-682-5301.) (CL) (KL)",
5,"Ambrose, Trinity (Divide Co.)","(A building was completed in 1913 (Norlie p. 225) and the congregation ceased on 1-1-1989 (ELCA Archives, Chicago). From “Divide County: 1964”, p. 98 or 99: On either of those pages is a photograph of Knut Kvigne. In the background is a partial obscured altar painting likely a Bernard Plockhorst based “Christ Knocking” which was possibly completed by August Klagstad. The year of completion of the work is unknown. It is set into an altarpiece which is white with six thin finials.) (CL)",
6,"Amidon, Lebanon (Slope Co.)","(The original church was constructed in 1913 and the congregation moved to Amidon in 1963 and they built a new church in that year. From: (Lebanon Lutheran Church (Amidon, N.D.). Lebanon Lutheran Church, 75th Anniversary, 1911-1986: Amidon, North Dakota, June 29, 1986. Amidon, N.D.: The Church, 1986.): A photo of Lebanon's exterior of the original building as possibly completed in 1913. A photo of the c1927 altar painting c1927 from p.10. The “remodeled old church” as the caption may refer to the changes made to the interior between 1941-1949. Page 10 does not mention any additions of chancel furnishings or pews. Even the altar painting is implied as being added to the altar. It is certainly possible that the furnishings date from c1913 and note that the baptismal font at the left of the altar and the altar rail are dark wood. The altarpiece appears to be gold and white painted. A simple dark wood pastor's chair stand to the left of the altar and the pulpit appears to be a lectern style pulpit at the far right of the chancel. The pews are the knurled arm variety. The altarpiece resembles a #610 in August Klagstad's altarpiece catalog, minus the finial above the peak in a #610 which could have been removed as the ceiling was lowered in the interior remodeling. The #610 does demonstrate a decorative element between the finials above the peak panels at the left and right of the painting, but the panels indicate a rectangular form instead of spade arches in the catalog version. The peak panel above the painting also holds a trefoil here and in the catalog version a quatrefoil. The furnishings very likely could be from the Klagstad Studio given that August Klagstad began selling altars and church furnishings in 1915 from Minneapolis. However, the altar painting is an unusual version of “Christ Knocking at the Door”. As I indicated the altar painting dates from c1927. The church history speaks of Pastor G.O. Fjesseth who came in 7-1927 and in the fall formed a youth group in which everyone attended. This group was responsible for buying the altar painting. After a few years the youth group dissolved. So, it would stand to reason that the group acquired the painting early on. This begs the question of what was in the altarpiece niche before? Was there anything in the niche between c1913 and c1927? It isn't unheard of for congregations to put temporary items in the niche such as hardanger items. Some congregations simply left them empty until a painting could be added. But if the altarpiece and furnishings are from the Klagstad Studio why wasn't an altar painting acquired at the time they were purchased? More research is needed to the answer these questions such as a pre-1927 photo of Lebanon's interior. But at the very least it may be possible to deduce the who is the artist of the altar painting. By c1927 in North Dakota the research has shown there were likely only four possibilities remaining regarding those persons or entities who completed altar paintings. An itinerant or local artist, St. Lukes Insititute from Milwaukee, Wisconsin, August Klagstad or Arne Berger. It doesn't appear that this work was completed by an itinerant or local artist unless the individual had been classically trained. So, if it is established that the artist was classically trained or had some classical training this would include the last three mentioned. Here we have an interesting element in the altar painting as Christ is shown knocking to the viewer's right. I have found amongst most artists that use this version of “Christ Knocking at the Door” Christ knocks to the viewers left. In two churches of Palermo, Faith and Ray, Ray I documented “Christ Knocking at the Door” paintings which were verified as being sold by the St. Lukes Institute. This holds true as it does amongst the countless August Klagstad “Christ Knocking at the Door” works. This then brings us to the likely possibility of Arne Berger. His years of production in North Dakota were from the 1920s-1934 when his career ended. Who in the small sample size painted in 1931 a “Christ Knocking at the Door” for Oberon, Calvary. And in that work Christ faces to the viewers right. Granted that beyond this feature the paintings differ in subject treatment but this clue may point to the artist being Arne Berger. A note on the difference in subject treatment. In the Calvary work the background scenery is much the more traditional altar paintings mentioned above. The lattice work opening in the door next to Christ's head and that door made of wooden slats is deeply set into an arch which is part of a building made of dressed stone. In the Amidon altar painting it is difficult to tell how the door is configured as it appears it may be some type of Dutch door. The building is unique in what I remember in documenting altar paintings of this type. Nowhere do I recall Jesus knocking at a door in a structure such as this. With its large pillars and high walls perhaps reminiscent of the temple in Jerusalem. As always, the best way to learn who is the artist of the altar painting and and to discover more about the church furnishings origins is to visit the present Lebanon church in Amidon to see what remains of the items and any records that provide details.",Photo insert of remodeled building completed c1936.Photo insert of the building which was constructed in Amidon in 1963.)

7,"Arndt/Egeland, Zion/Arndt Missouri Synod/Iowa Synod (Towner Co.)","(The edifice was constructed in 1901 and the church closed in 1941 (Hadler, Mabel Lyles Jacques. History of Arndt, North Dakota. [Place of publication not identified]: [publisher not identified], 1943. p ?). The congregation’s building was then moved to Rocklake to become the All Nations Lutheran church according to (Held, Ruth Ann. All Nations Lutheran Church History Book, 1898-1998. [Rocklake, N.D.]: [The Church], 1998. p. 2). In the All Nations Lutheran church history, this quote was printed on page 9 “The altar, lectern and pulpit were made by Ole Johnson and E. Fraimson, members of the congregation.” This took place in 1949, suggesting that either the Zion/Arndt building was moved empty or that the original furnishings were replaced. In a conversation with Debbie Higgins at the work phone number of 701-477-3175 or home number of 701-266-5623 from Rocklake, she reported to me that the original altar is in the basement of the All Nations Lutheran church building. The altar is typical to many of the German Lutheran configurations, being somewhat low and moderately ornate, containing a crucifix within the niche. See Rocklake, All Nations.(CL)",
8,"Ashley, McIntosh County Heritage Center (McIntosh Co.)","(213 Third Ave NE. Sunday 2-5 pm or by appointment. The 1929 Ashley, Zion Iowa Synod, Number 2 building was moved to this site after it closed in 1977 (Ashley Centennial: A History of Ashley, North Dakota. Ashley, N.D.?: The Committee, 1988. p. 78). Ashley, Zion Iowa Synod, Number 2 was called this to avoid confusion with Ashley, Zion Iowa Synod, Number 1 which was completed in 1916 and it closed in 1962 (Ashley Centennial: A History of Ashley, North Dakota. Ashley, N.D.?: The Committee, 1988. p. 77 and Zion Lutheran Church (Ashley, N.D.). Celebration of God's Grace: 100th Anniversary, Zion Lutheran Church, Ashley, North Dakota, 1903-2003. Ashley? N.D.: The Church?, 2003. p. 52.). There is also another Ashley, Zion Iowa Synod Congregation that is currently located in that community. The 1966 church building was included in the documentation work. An original edifice had been completed in 1904 (Ashley Centennial: A History of Ashley, North Dakota. Ashley, N.D.?: The Committee, 1988. p. 73.) (CL)",
9,"Auburn, Landstad (Walsh Co.)","(The Landstad church was constructed in 1888. The congregation ceased operation in 1966 and sometime between this year and 1974 the building was moved to the Grafton, Grafton Heritage Park. The museum staff chose to hang in the church the painting “Sixteen Madonna”, although the actual title is the “Sistine Madonna” based on the original by Raphael Santi, by Grafton resident, altar painting artist and photographer, John Rindahl who completed the work in 1922. The painting hung in the lobby of the Grafton Deaconess Hospital, which was completed on 3-24-1902. Which closed or it was absorbed by the present day Unity Hospital which in 1995 donated the work to the Grafton, Heritage Park.) (CL)",
